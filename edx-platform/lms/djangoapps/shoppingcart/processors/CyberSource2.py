"""
Implementation of the CyberSource credit card processor using the newer "Secure Acceptance API".
The previous Hosted Order Page API is being deprecated as of 9/14.

For now, we're keeping the older implementation in the code-base so we can
quickly roll-back by updating the configuration.  Eventually, we should replace
the original implementation with this version.

To enable this implementation, add the following Django settings:

    CC_PROCESSOR_NAME = "CyberSource2"
    CC_PROCESSOR = {
        "CyberSource2": {
            "SECRET_KEY": "<secret key>",
            "ACCESS_KEY": "<access key>",
            "PROFILE_ID": "<profile ID>",
            "PURCHASE_ENDPOINT": "<purchase endpoint>"
        }
    }
